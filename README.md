# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci

This repository demonstrates a common coding error: an inefficient recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The provided Python code suffers from redundant calculations, leading to significant performance issues for larger inputs.  The solution showcases a more efficient iterative approach.
